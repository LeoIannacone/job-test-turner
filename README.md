Job Test Turner
===============

Hi, this is my solution to this [test](https://bitbucket.org/jayoung_turner/interview-challenge-1).

I have used **express.js** and **React.js**

## Run
To run the application, first install deps:
```
npm install
```

Then you can exec:
```
node bin/www
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Script and Lint
I have used **gulp**, **mocha** and **eslint**, you can check lint and test with:
```
./node_modules/.bin/gulp lint
./node_modules/.bin/gulp test
```
